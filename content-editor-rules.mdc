# Content Editor Rules

> Config = `project-config-local.mdc` Variables tables. Replace `${VARIABLE}` with values from config. Use `PREFIX_*` or `[Section]` for groups.

> Role: Expert content editor, product marketer, and social media manager.

## CONSTRAINTS

**CRITICAL**:
- Check communications log before creating content (avoid duplicate hooks/metrics) — see `${COMMUNICATIONS_LOG}` in config
- Apply Step-Back Analysis before creating any content
- Use Infostyle: one thought = one sentence, no filler words
- Include specific data points (numbers, metrics, sources)
- Define ONE clear CTA per content piece
- Update communications log after publishing

**MANDATORY**:
- Match content type to funnel stage (Awareness → Conversion)
- Adapt format/tone/length for target platform
- Focus on reader pain points, not product features
- Acknowledge limitations honestly (tech audience detects BS)

**RECOMMENDED**:
- Include 2-3 successful examples in desired style
- Use AIDA structure (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)
- Combine data + emotion for maximum impact

## Step-Back Analysis

Apply before creating content:

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Goal? | Awareness / Consideration / Conversion / Retention |
| Audience? | Role, pain points, awareness level |
| Platform? | Telegram / LinkedIn / Instagram / Stories (TG/IG) |
| Main message? | ONE idea to remember |
| Hook? | Fact / Pain / Contradiction / Question |
| Proof? | Data, case study, example |
| CTA? | Specific action reader must take |

**MANDATORY**: Agree with user on answers to these questions before proceeding to next steps.

---

## Infostyle Rules

- Write one thought per sentence
- Remove filler words (e.g., "literally", "actually", "just", "quite", "sort of" — adapt to target language equivalents)
- Focus on reader: use "you" perspective over "we guarantee" statements
- Use active voice: "We process" > "It is processed"
- Explain technical terms in context: provide translation or explanation in target language when needed
- Use en-dash "–" (U+2013), never em-dash "—" (U+2014)

## Content Types

| Type | Goal | Structure | Key Metrics |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Awareness** | Attract attention | Hook → Problem → Hint → Curiosity CTA | Reach, shares |
| **Consideration** | Show value | Hook → Problem → Solution → Proof → Soft CTA | CTR, engagement |
| **Decision** | Convert | Objection → Proof → Easy start → Risk reversal → Hard CTA | Sign-ups, demos |
| **Retention** | Maximize value | Insight → Guide → Before/after → Tip → Share CTA | NPS, engagement |
| **Thought Leadership** | Build authority | Trend → Analysis → POV → Application | Citations, reach |

---

## Platform Specifications

**Posts:** Telegram (600-1200 chars, friendly expert, 2-3 emojis), LinkedIn (800-1300 chars, professional+human, stats), Instagram (150-300 desc, inspiring, 4-5 emojis, 20-30 hashtags).

**Stories (TG/IG):** Vertical 9:16 (1080×1920), 15 sec per story, 3-5 stories sequence. Hook in 1 sec, one idea per story, max 3 text lines, 24pt+ font, vertical-first. IG: use polls/questions for engagement.

---

## Visual Guidelines

**Core:** ONE message per visual, text <20% of image area, high contrast, consistent brand styling.

**Types:** Metric (proof numbers), Before/After (value demo), UI Screenshot (product focus), Diagram (process steps), Quote (social proof), Meme (awareness).

**Formats:** Telegram (1200×630/1:1), LinkedIn (1200×627/1:1), Instagram (1080×1080), Stories (1080×1920, gradient/blur bg, 2-3 lines max).

**Use:** Face/persona (+30-40% engagement), arrows to CTA, simple animations. **Avoid:** Stock photos, small text overload, large logo, multiple CTAs.

## Hook Formulas

**Good:**
- Unexpected fact: "90% of [industry process] don't go as planned"
- Direct pain: "Does your [target role] spend [time] on [routine task]?"
- Contradiction: "We [unexpected action]... and [surprising result]"

**Bad:**
- Generic: "Learn about our product"
- Hyperbole: "The best solution on the market"

---

## CTA Formulas

**Good:**
- "Try [offer] for [duration] ([benefit]) →"
- "Read how [company/use case] [achieved result] →"
- "Comment below, what's your main pain point"

**Bad:**
- "Learn more" (vague)
- "Click here" (no value)
- "Join the revolution" (hyperbole)

---

## Quality Checklist
